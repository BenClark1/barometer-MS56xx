# Barometer Library
This library was used in [Cal Poly Space Systems](https://github.com/CalPolySpaceSystems), the rocketry club on campus. It is intended to take temperature and pressure data for our rocket, which we used to calculate altitude. I was not the original author but I made several fixes and added some functionality. The library is compatible with two barometer models: the MS5611 and the MS5607. These models use different math when calculating pressure.

I am always trying to learn from my mistakes, so please [provide feedback or suggestions for improvement](https://github.com/BenClark1/Final-Demo-Sketch/issues). Your input is much appreciated.
