# Barometer Library
This library was used in Cal Poly Space Systems to get altitude, temperature, and pressure data for our rocket. I was not the original author but I made several fixes and added some functionality. I made the library compatible with two barometer models: the MS5611 and the MS5607. These models use different math when calculating pressure, so be sure to specify which model you are using when calling the initMS56xx function.

I am always trying to learn from my mistakes, so please [provide feedback or suggestions for improvement](https://github.com/BenClark1/Final-Demo-Sketch/issues).
